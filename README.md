# Airline_data_analysis
The end goal of this task would be to identify opportunities to increase the 
occupancy rate on low-performing flights, which can ultimately lead to 
increased profitability for the airline. Furthermore, boosting occupancy rates should not come at the price of consumer 
happiness or safely. Airlines must strike a balance between the necessity for profit 
and the significance of delivering high-quality service and upholding safely regulations.
